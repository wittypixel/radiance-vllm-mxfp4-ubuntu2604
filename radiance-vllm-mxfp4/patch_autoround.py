"""Register the radiance `auto-round` quantization config early enough for ModelConfig to see it.

The config itself lives in radiance_autoround.py and registers via
`@register_quantization_config("auto-round")`. The only hard part is WHEN that decorator runs: it
has to be before `ModelConfig._verify_quantization` resolves the checkpoint's `quant_method`, and
after vLLM is importable.

Three earlier hooks do not work, which is why this exists:

  * a throwaway `python3 -c "import radiance_autoround"` before the engine starts. The registry is
    process state, so it is gone by the time `vllm serve` runs.
  * `sitecustomize.py` dropped in site-packages. The radiance image already ships
    /usr/lib/python3.13/sitecustomize.py, which comes FIRST on sys.path and shadows it -- the file
    is simply never imported, silently.
  * vLLM's general-plugin entry points. Those load during engine/worker init, but ModelConfig is
    built during argument parsing, which is earlier.

Patching the end of the quantization package's __init__ is both early enough and late enough:
`register_quantization_config` is defined by that point, and anything importing the registry has
necessarily executed this line first.

Without it the engine dies before building a single layer. vLLM ships an INC (Intel Neural
Compressor) config whose `override_quantization_method` maps quant_method "auto-round" straight to
"inc", and INC refuses to run on ROCm:

    Value error, inc quantization is currently not supported in rocm.

With the config registered, ModelConfig probes CUSTOM methods before the built-in override list
("auto-round" is not in the QuantizationMethods literal), so AutoRoundConfig's own
`override_quantization_method` claims the checkpoint first -- and only claims 4-bit group-128
symmetric, which is what the kernel actually supports.

Gated on RADIANCE_AUTOROUND so a build that is not serving an AutoRound checkpoint imports nothing.
