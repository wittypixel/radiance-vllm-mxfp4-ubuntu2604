"""The whole libr4d integration, in one patch, switchable at run time with RADIANCE_USE_R4D.

libr4d is a library of hand-written gfx1201 (RDNA4) kernels. vLLM reaches into it from several
places, but only three of them need a source edit, and they are here together because they are one
feature: a build either has the R4D library wired in or it does not. A single switch for it is only
meaningful if there is a single place that says what "it" is.

  1. THE ATTENTION BACKEND. The enum in vllm/v1/attention/backends/registry.py is what the CLI, the
     speculative-decoding config and the platform selector all resolve names against, and a Python
     Enum cannot be extended after it is created -- so the member is added to the source. R4D is
     deliberately NOT added to the platform's auto-selection list: it is an explicit opt-in through
     `--attention-backend R4D`, and everything else keeps its defaults.

  2. THE GDN LAYER. A prologue on _forward_core runs a whole gated-delta-net step in five
     hand-written kernels -- conv_prep, kkt_solve and chunk_scan on the prefill path, conv_update
     and recurrent_update on the decode path -- and returns False for any step shape it does not
     cover, leaving the original body to run untouched. The reason this is at the layer and not at
     the op seams is the convolution: fusing it with the split, the qk l2 norm, the gating and the
     gate cumsum keeps its output (34 MB per layer per rank at this model's chunk size) out of HBM
     entirely, and no op-level hook can see both ends of that.

  3. THE FLA CHUNK PATH. For any step the layer hook declines, this still routes the last three of
     FLA's five prefill kernels -- recompute_w_u_fwd, chunk_gated_delta_rule_fwd_h and chunk_fwd_o
     -- to the fused chunk scan, so the fallback path is not the unaccelerated one.

RADIANCE_USE_R4D (default 1) is read by the radiance_* modules the injected code calls into, not by
the injected code here: this patch is applied once at image build, and what a serve needs is to be
able to take the library out of the picture without a rebuild. Set it to 0 and every hook is still
installed and every one of them declines, so the fallbacks -- FLA/Triton for the gated delta net,
the Triton kernel for vision attention, RCCL for the all-reduce, rocBLAS for the skinny GEMMs -- run
exactly as they would in an image built without the library. `--attention-backend R4D` then refuses
at startup, which is better than quietly serving something slower than what was asked for.

Every edit is idempotent and anchors on source that would have to change for the replacement to be
wrong, so drift shows up as a failed build rather than as a silent divergence.

NOT PATCHED: the gated RMS norm. `_output_projection` runs INSIDE the compiled region, so a python
call there is a Dynamo `Unsupported method call` and the model fails to compile -- and the same
region is where vLLM's fuse_norm_quant pass may already have claimed the norm. The kernel exists
(`gdn_gated_rmsnorm_h128_bf16`, and the decode kernel can fold the same arithmetic into its
epilogue), but wiring it needs a registered custom op and a trace that prices what the norm actually
costs today. Left out rather than shipped on a guess."""
