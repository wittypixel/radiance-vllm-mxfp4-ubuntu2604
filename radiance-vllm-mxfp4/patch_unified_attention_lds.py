"""Build-time source patch for AITER's unified attention on RDNA (gfx1201 / R9700). Three idempotent
string replacements on the installed site-packages copy of unified_attention.py.

1. LDS fit (correctness, unconditional, both config selectors). The attention kernels stage a
   TILE_SIZE x next_pow2(head_size) K/V tile num_stages deep in shared memory, at the KV cache element
   size, plus ~256 B. AITER sizes that tile for CDNA's much larger LDS; the R9700 has 64 KiB, so
   several of its own picks do not fit and Triton raises OutOfResources at cudagraph capture:
     head_size 256, 2-byte KV : 64*256*2*2 + 256 = 65792
     head_size 512, fp8    KV : 64*512*1*2 + 256 = 65792   (Gemma4's global-attention layers)
   Both selectors now step num_stages, then TILE_SIZE, down until the tile fits. This is a hard
   requirement, not a preference, so it lives in source and applies whether or not the runtime
   tuned-config hook is installed (that hook is a tune; this is a correctness clamp).

2. bf16/fp16 (2-byte, incl. --kv-cache-dtype auto) 3D-decode tune. do_bench-optimal at head_size 256:
   TILE 16, warps 4, stages 2, waves 2, reduce warps 4 (warps=4 is the lever: +14% decode, 4-7x
   prefill). This must be a source patch rather than part of the tuned-config wrapper because that
   wrapper is bypassed for the bf16 3D path in-serve.
