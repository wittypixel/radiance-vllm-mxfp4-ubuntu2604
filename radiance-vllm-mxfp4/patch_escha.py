"""Register the radiance `escha` quantization config early enough for ModelConfig to see it.

Identical timing problem to patch_autoround.py, and identical solution: the decorator has to run
before `ModelConfig._verify_quantization` resolves the checkpoint's `quant_method`, and after vLLM
is importable. A throwaway import beforehand is lost with the process; sitecustomize.py is shadowed
by the image's own copy; and vLLM's plugin entry points load during engine init, which is after
ModelConfig is built during argument parsing.

Unlike auto-round there is no built-in method fighting for the name -- "escha" is unknown to vLLM
entirely, so without this the engine simply reports an unsupported quantization method and exits.

Gated on RADIANCE_ESCHA so a build not serving an escha checkpoint imports nothing.
